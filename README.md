# numberGenerator
This program takes in a user inputted integer, calculates various mathematical values for it, and returns them to the console. This program includes various mathematical functions and various methods. 
When the user inputs a number of their choice, the program determines whether or not the number is odd or even by using modulus. It also prints out the number divided by 2, multiplied by 2, and squared. 
In order to solve the issue of odd numbers being rounded down when divided by 2, I created a method that took an int and returned a double divided by 2 in order to ensure that the decimal was placed. 
This final project singlehandedly made me realize that Computer Science is not the major for me.
